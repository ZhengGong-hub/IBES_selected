e. looking at c. and d., does it look normal that most of the analysts do not cover same stocks anymore when they changed employer (broker)? i think it is strange...

f. unique id... analyst name, 

scenario:
IBES data

name          ID     --> name'   BROKER   coveraging stock
ZHU H.    x123       ZHU H.1     gs
ZHU H.    x234       ZHU H.2     jp
ZHU H.    x345       ZHU H.3     citi

CIQ data
full name     BROKER
ZHU HONG      gs
ZHU Heng      jp
ZHu Hang      citi

with the plague of names

step 1. 
same name+initial, with different ids. --> 

step 2. 
with broker name -->
